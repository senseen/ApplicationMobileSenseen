# Presentation of the Senseen application : 

•	 Launching the application 

First of all, after launching the application, two choices are possible: 
- To connect to the platform (i.e. connect to your account or create one)  
- To use the offline mode. The latter does not require an internet connection unlike the former.

To use the scanner the first time, it is necessary to connect to the platform at least once to create a crop. A crop is for example wheat, rape, etc.. It can be given a description to better differentiate the crops when there are several of them. 
To create a new crop, go to the tab 'my profile' then 'add a crop'.

•	 Bluetooth connection

Now, to use the scanner, you must connect it. For that, click on the tab 'Bluetooth' in the top right of the application. Then 'configure a device'. It is enough to select our scanner. Its name begins with 'NIR'. This configuration will allow the application to know with which scanner it must communicate during a scan. 

•	 To make a scan

On the tab 'Products', we can see in a drop-down list the different cultures that we have created. We then have the possibility to make only a scan of our culture (usually in a collaborative process and research to improve our prediction algorithm) as well as to make a prediction of the culture. For the moment, only two products are available for prediction: wheat and rapeseed. Other products will be added soon. 
Once you have clicked on one of the two possibilities. The application will synchronize with the scanner in order to perform a scan. When this is done the scan button will turn red meaning that the scanner is ready to scan. Before starting the scan, we have the possibility to choose between 'add measurements' or 'do not add measurements'. This allows the user to enter his own measurements that he could have done by hand. For example, redox or pH measurements with the Husson kit. 
Once the scan button is clicked (on the phone or on the senseen scanner) the scanner will perform 3 scans. The curves of each scan will be displayed on the screen (green then blue then red). Once the scans are finished. If you have chosen to add measurements, a popup will be displayed allowing the user to enter the measurements he has made. 
Moreover, if we have chosen to make only one scan, it will be saved directly in the cloud (in the phone if we are in the offline mode). A message will be displayed on the screen to warn of the saving. One can click on the button to save the scan if no message appears within 5 seconds.
On the other hand, if one has chosen to make a prediction, once the scans have been made the application will display the prediction page directly. With the different measurements that have been predicted like the redox potential and the ph. It also displays the temperature, humidity, pressure and the name of the city where the user is located. 
To save the prediction in the cloud, click on the button at the bottom.
You cannot save the prediction in the offline mode since you need an internet connection to receive the prediction). 

•	Saving a scan in the cloud after using the offline mode

If you have saved scans in the phone. It is possible to save them later in the cloud. To do this, you need to connect to the platform. Once connected, you must go to the tab 'my profile' and click on 'upload a scan'.
Then in the phone, you have to go to 'Documents' then the 'senseen' folder and select the file containing our scans. You can select several at the same time.
Once the scans are loaded, we can either launch the prediction (only available for one scan) or save the scan on the cloud. 

•	 Modification of your personal information

To do this, go to the 'my profile' tab and click on the profile picture. Now you can fill in the different fields such as the phone number and your address.
